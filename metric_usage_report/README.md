# Deprecated use official API Endpoint

This feature now has it's own built-in endpoint: [https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/latest/metrics/#related-assets-to-a-metric](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/latest/metrics/#related-assets-to-a-metric)

The `Related Assets to a Metric` endpoint is more stable and gets updated for any new assets.

# ~Metrics Usage Report~

## ~Overview~

~This program utilizes the [datadogpy API library](https://github.com/DataDog/datadogpy) to accept a list of metric names and return a list of dashboards and monitors in your account that use those metrics in their queries.~


## ~Instructions~

1. ~Add your [API and App keys](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/latest/authentication/) to [config.py](config.py).~
2. ~Add your metric names into [config.py](config.py).~
3. ~Run `python3 report.py`~

~Reports will be placed in the results folder under the names `report.*`~

## ~Example Output~

- ~[Markdown Example File](results/example_usage_report.md)~
- ~[CSV Example File](results/example_usage_report.csv)~
- ~[JSON Example File](results/example_usage_report.json)~

## ~Technical Details~

### ~Caching~

~API calls are expensive and time consuming. To avoid requesting all dashboard definitions from your account every time you want a metric report, results are cached in json format in the file `db_cache.txt`. If that file exists, the script will automatically use those results instead.~

~To get a fresh list of dashboards, either rename or delete the file `db_cache.txt`.~

### ~untitled Widgets~

~If a widget doesn't have a title, dashboards will generate one based off the query inside. That logic was a bit too complex for me to replicate, so I just named them `unitled` to avoid having an empty string when displaying the widget in the report.~
