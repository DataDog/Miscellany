# vault_executable
A python script to serve secrets fetched from HashiCorp Vault  to a Datadog agent

### Introduction

Customers can fetch secrets from providers like HashiCorp Vault and serve those secrets to the Datadog agent via executable file. Customers often ask us for support with creating the executable, we do have basic examples of a python executable in our documentation but wanted to take it a step further and provide a simple but working example of a executable that fetches secrets from HashiCorp Vault and serves them to the Datadog agent.

### Setup

You will need a HashiCorp Vault secret cluster is necessary to store secrets in the vault.



You can add secrets to the vault using the steps below

### Results Returned from Vault

The results are returned in `<KEY>:<VALUE>` pairs like below. You can test massing secret keys as defined in your agent configuration to see what your executable returns (as the agent sees it).
```
‚ùØ bash -c "echo '{\"version\": \"1.0\", \"secrets\": [\"host\", \"test-snmp\"]}' | python3 /Users/brian.hartford/Documents/secrets/hashi_vault_api.py"
api-key: <REDACTED>
first-secret: Vault Is The Way
host: localhost
test-key: test
test-snmp: test-snmp-password
{"host": {"value": "localhost", "error": null}, "test-snmp": {"value": "test-snmp-password", "error": null}}
```
